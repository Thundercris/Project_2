# General Assembly Project 2:  The CockTailor (React app using external API + Game)

## Overview

The CockTailor App uses a third party API from CocktailDB to show the list of cocktails, their ingredients and images. This information was also used to build the cocktail game.

## Timeframe

2 days

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript 
* React
* HTML
* CSS
* SASS
* Bulma
* Insomnia 
* Deployed through netlify

## Navigate and Play a deployed version

* The CockTailor -> https://thecocktailor.netlify.app/Cocktails

## Installation

* Navigate and play the deployed version online.
* Clone or download the repo, run the command yarn start.

## Brief

* A pair-coded Hackathon style project to develop a React app using an external API. The app should be then styled using CSS/SASS and Bulma.

## Approach

We initially took some time to analyse the API and understand how to extract the information. 
Based on the API’ structure we decide to allocate the time to build the following parts: the game (quiz cocktail edition), the list of cocktails offered (organised by alphabetical order) and a description card, containing the cocktail information.


Users are able to search for cocktails by clicking in the Navbar section “See all our cocktails”. By choosing one of the letters, all cocktails starting with that letter will be shown inside the cards.

Once the cocktail has been chosen, the user can click on the card to learn more about the ingredients, the recipe, and the type of drinking glasses the cocktail is served in.

The third section of the Navbar is the game, where users can test their knowledge by playing a quiz to guess the name of the drink displayed on the card on the left hand side which contains the picture and the ingredients.

## Challenges

* Understanding and navigating the API. We spent some time reading the documentation provided by the API’s website and testing the requests in Insomnia.


## Wins

* Managing to navigate the API and get the requests we wanted.
* Building a functional quiz game and using the information contained in the API.

## Key Learnings/Takeaway

Pair programming was a very good experience. My partner and I learned a lot from each not only in terms of coding but also in terms of managing the time properly in order to get done all sections we planned to do. I learned how to work with bulma which saved us a lot of time from the styling and I definitely feel more confident using the CSS framework.
I also deployed the project using netlify. This gave me the opportunity to learn how to solve some of the errors I got during the stages of deployment and successfully see the application live and working correctly.

## Future features

* Improve the design of the card’s drink description and the game.
